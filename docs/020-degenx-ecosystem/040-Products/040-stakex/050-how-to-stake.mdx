# STAKEX - How To Stake

1. Enter the amount of the staking token into the (1) text field. You will be notified if the entered amount exceeds your available account balance. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/1.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

2. If the protocol allows different (1) Reward Multiplier & Duration(s), you have to choose one of them in order to proceed with the depositing process. This will be the staking pool you are about to join. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/2.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

3. If the protocol has a certain lock period configured, you need to check the (1) checkbox to confirm that you’re aware that the tokens you are going to deposit will be locked for the selected period and are not retrievable until then. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/3.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

4. If you followed and executed the 3 steps before, the Deposit button will be enabled, so you can click on it. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/4.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
 
5. Below the Deposit button, you see a box with information in it. You will see information about (1) the amount of the staking token you are about to stake. If the protocol has a deposit fee enabled, you will see (2) the amount of the staking token that is getting charged for depositing. You get (3) information about the currently selected reward multiplier. If the staking pool has a lock period configured, you will see the (4) lock duration. This duration is about how long your deposited tokens will be locked in the selected pool. You will also receive the information about (5) when you deposited tokens are available again, so you can withdraw. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/5.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />

For this, check your wallet and follow the instructions. <br /><br /><img src={require('/img/stakex/how-to-stake/9.png').default} style={{maxWidth: 400}} />
