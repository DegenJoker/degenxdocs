### Influence Governance

    Your DGNX tokens grant you a voice in the DEGENX community. You can create and vote on proposals, influencing the direction and development of the ecosystem. It's a democratic way of ensuring the platform evolves to meet its users' needs. **Learn more about [DEGENX DAO](/docs/020-degenx-ecosystem/050-Governance/010-intro.md).**

### Revenue-Sharing Rewards

    One of the perks of being part of DEGENX is sharing in the ecosystem's success. Revenue generated from various services and products is distributed back to DGNX stakers. This means the more the ecosystem grows, the more rewards you can potentially earn. **Learn more about [StakeX](/docs/020-degenx-ecosystem/040-Products/040-staking.md)**

	
### Liquidity Backing

    Enjoy maximum security with our Liquidity Backing mechanism. Your investments are safeguarded with an independent growing pool of assets, creating an internal value for the DGNX token separate from it’s market value. **Learn more about [Liquidity Backing](020-degenx-ecosystem/040-Products/Liquidity_Backing/010-liquidity-backing.md)**

### Explore Innovative DeFi Products

    DEGENX isn't just about staking and governance. It's a gateway to a wide range of DeFi products across multiple blockchains. Our aim is to build an ecosystem of products and services to simplify the world of DeFi and make it more accessible to all.

:::note
DEGENX Staking protocol is currently in production. Revenue is being collected from various other products and will be deposited in staking pools at launch.
