title: What is a Token Fee?
description: A comprehensive guide to token fees.

A token fee, also known as token tax, refers to the charge applied when purchasing, selling, or transferring a particular token. 

Such tokens, known for incorporating transaction fees, are termed fee-on-transfer tokens. These fees are predetermined by the creator or issuer of the token and are directly collected by them, not by trading platforms like BroccoliSwap.

For a transaction involving these tokens to proceed, any applicable buy or sell fees must be cleared. This means if the token in question implements a fee for buying, selling, or transferring, this charge must be satisfied for the transaction to go through.
