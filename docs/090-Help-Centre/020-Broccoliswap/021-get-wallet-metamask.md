## Securing Your MetaMask Wallet

:::warning
While it's safe to share your wallet address, remember to keep your private key and recovery phrase confidential.

### Secret Recovery Phrases (SRP)

SRPs are crucial for wallet recovery and ownership verification. Unlike social media accounts, MetaMask does not offer conventional password recovery options, making SRP vital for accessing your wallet across devices.

### Private Keys

Each wallet address comes with a unique private key, essential for authorizing transactions. It's crucial to keep your private key confidential to prevent unauthorized access to your funds.

### Self-Custodianship

As a MetaMask user, you're the sole custodian of your wallet. This non-custodial approach emphasizes the importance of securing your assets and being vigilant against unauthorized access attempts.

## Using Your MetaMask Wallet

### Connecting to Blockchains

MetaMask allows interaction with various EVM-compatible blockchains, setting Ethereum as the default network. However, it does not support non-EVM chains like Bitcoin, Solana, or Cardano directly.

### Adding Tokens

To receive tokens, use your wallet address and ensure compatibility with EVM chains. MetaMask's 'enhanced token detection' feature helps in identifying and adding tokens to your wallet.

### Swapping and Sending Tokens

MetaMask facilitates token swaps directly from the wallet, offering competitive rates across DEXs. When sending tokens, double-check recipient addresses and be mindful of gas fees, which vary with network congestion and transaction priority.
